The AlgorithmX smart contract, based on obfuscated transactions (Privacy), is a contract implemented on the Ethereum platform that creates and manages an ERC20 token called "Algorithm X" with the token "NSzabo". The contract inherits from the standard ERC20 contracts, Ownable (for owner management) and Pausable (for the ability to pause contract operations).

The contract has the following main functionalities:

Token Transfer: Allows token holders to transfer their Algorithm X tokens to other addresses. However, in this implementation, the transfer is done in an obfuscated and private way, dividing the number of tokens into 10 equal parts and sending them to 10 random addresses generated based on timestamp, index, and sender address. . The tokens are then transferred from those random addresses to the destination (to) address. This may be aimed at improving the privacy and fungibility of transferred tokens.
